# las3009_assignment

This project attempts to fulfill the requirements for the LAS3009 (Single Page Applications: A pragmatic approach) assignment. These requirements can be found in AssignmentBrief.pdf.

The following should help in setting up the single page application so that it can be used. Please view 'evalLogo_an_overview.pdf' for more information on the application's functionality.

The steps assume that git and node.js are available on the system being run.

1.  clone the git repository in a directory of your choice using:

      git clone https://github.com/georgebonanno/las3009_assignment.git

2.  enter the closed directory:

      cd las3009_assignment

3.  download all required node and bower dependencies using

      a.  npm install
      b.  bower install

4.  The server for serving REST requests can be started using
  
      json-server --watch db.json

5.  The following commands should allow the application to be accessed through localhost:1234:

      grunt serve

6.  The backoffice page (see AssignmentBrief.pdf for a description) can be accessed through the following url:

      http://localhost:1234/evalLogo

    The following credentials can be used to login:

      name: george
      password: gbon0001

      or

      name: admin1
      password: passadmin1

  note: the sha224 of the password is stored in db.json. This is generated by the sha224 function from the following script:

    bower_components/js-sha256/src/sha256.js

7.  the logo evaluator (public facing application) can be accessed through this url:

      http://localhost:1234/evalLogo/logo

    command examples:
      a. draw a square: repeat[4,fd(40); rt(90); ];
      b. draw two adjacent squares separated by a line: repeat[4,fd(40); rt(90); ]; c. lt(90); fd(70); repeat[4,fd(40); rt(90); ];
      d.  draw a rectangle: repeat[360,fd(1); rt(1);];
      e.  draw a circle: repeat[360,fd(1); rt(1);];
      f.  draw 3 circles: repeat[3,repeat[360,fd(1); rt(1);];lt(90); fd(40);];
      g.  draw 2 circles with commands spanning multiple lines (i.e. each command is on a separate line): 
      	lt(180);
      	repeat[360,fd(1); rt(1);];
      	fd(30)
      	lt(90)
      	fd(60);
      	repeat[360,fd(1); rt(1);];
